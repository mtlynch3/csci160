    <h4>Textbook</h4>
    <p><b>Digital Design, 5th edition</b> by M. Morris Mano & Michael D. Ciletti; Pearson Prentice Hall, 2012, ISBN10: 0132774208. </p>
    <hr>

    <h4>Topics and learning outcomes</h4>
    <p>We will spend the semester learning how to design digital circuits as used in modern computing devices. After a review of logic, binary numbers, and boolean algebra (Chs 1 & 2), we will discuss gate level implementation and minimization (Ch 3), and various specific combinational circuits (Ch 4). From here we move to a study of synchronous sequential logic (Ch 5), various types of registers and counters (Ch 6), and various types of memory (Ch 7).</p> 

    <p>This class supports the Department's Program Learning Outcome 1B (demonstrating an understanding of the overarching relationships between hardware and software) as well as starting students on the road to 1C (knowledge of finite automata). The successful student will be able to implement any combinational circuit with any complete set of gates and any sequential circuit with any type of flip-flop. Abstraction will be reinforced through the use of sub-circuitry to implement more useful circuits (e.g. using half adders to build adders which are then used to build n-bit adder-subtracters).

    <h4>Grades</h4>
    <p>You will be assessed through homework assignments and examinations. The grading breakdown is as follows:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Homework - 15%</li>
      <li>Midterm Exam 1 - 10%</li>
      <li>Midterm Exam 2 - 25%</li>
      <li>Midterm Exam 3 - 25%</li>
      <li>Final Exam - 25%</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you miss a midterm exam, you get a 0 on that exam; there are no makeup exams. You can choose to replace ONE midterm score with the score on your final exam. </p>
    <p>Refer to the <a href="hw-exam-info.html">Homework and Exam Information Page</a> for more details on homework and exam logistics.</p>

    <h4>Policy on Academic Integrity</h4>
    <p> Hunter College regards acts of academic dishonesty (e.g. plagiarism, cheating on examinations, obtaining unfair advantage, and falsification of records and official documents) as serious offenses against the values of intellectual honesty. The College is committed to enforcing the CUNY Policy on Academic Integrity and will pursue cases of academic dishonesty according to the Hunter College Academic Integrity Procedures.</p>
    <hr>

    <h4>Policy on Bullying</h4>
    <p>Bullying, cyberbullying, online hate, intimidation, threats, harassment, and pressure to share schoolwork are all forms of violence. CUNY holds a zero tolerance stance towards all such acts. The University is committed to prevention of any form of bullying, will respond promptly to threats and/or acts, and will protect victims of bullying from retaliation. As a criminal matter, the New York Attorney General defines cyberbullying as the use of email, websites, instant messaging, chat rooms, text messaging and digital cameras to antagonize and intimidate others. Disrupting a teleconferencing platform (such as Zoom) is a federal crime.</p>
